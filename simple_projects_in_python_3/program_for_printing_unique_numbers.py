# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers.
# Display all numbers. For numbers with duplicate, display only the first entry.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers with spaces in between
numbers = input("Input 10 numbers separated by space: ")    # example "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3"

# create a list for the numbers given by the user
# set a variable with an empy list as a container for unique numbers
# iterate an item in range(10) using for loop
# if number not in the unique list,
