# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Display all numbers that don't have duplicate.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers 
numbers = input("Enter 10 numbers with spaces  in between: ")    # example "1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 8"

# create a list for the numbers given by the user
num_list = numbers.split()

# set a variable with an empy list
unique_num = []

# iterate an item in range(10)

# if a number is not in the list,

# add the number to that list

# if a number is a duplicate

# skip

# print the number
