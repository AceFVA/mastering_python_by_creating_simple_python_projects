# Create a program that ask the user to input their fullname in incorrect casing. Print the input in snake case.

# ask the user to input his/her full name in an incorrect casing
full_name = input("Enter your full name in an incorrect casing: ")

# convert casing into lower case
in_lower_case = full_name.lower()

# convert " " to "_"


# print full name in snake case
print(in_lower_case)
