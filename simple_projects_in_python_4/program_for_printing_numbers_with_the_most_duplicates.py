# Create a program that ask user to input a number, continue asking until the user input is invalid.
# Display the number with the most number of duplicate.

# create an empty list
# ask the user to input a number continuously until the input is invalid
# add the inputted number on the list
# create most_duplicated and most_count for most duplicated and most counted number with initial value of 0
# iterate the number from the list
# count = count of inputted number on the list
# if count is greater than most_count,
# most_duplicated = inputted number
# most_count = count
# print the most duplicated number
