# islower() check if all characters of the string is on lower case.
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using islower() function.

# set a variable with a string of characters
# set a variable with an initialized value of 0 for counting number of lowercased and alphanumeric characters
# iterate all items in the given string
# if char is not in uppercase,
# lower case variable += 1
# if char is in alphanumeric character,
# lower case variable += 1
# if the length of lower case variable equal to length of the string
# print True
# if the length of lower case variable not equal to length of the string,
# print False
