# Create a program that do the same functionality without using upper() function.

# create an empty list of uppercased letters
# iterate all items in the given string
# if char in string is in lower case,
# convert to upper case and add to the list
# if char in string is not in lower case,
# add char to the list
# print the strinf in upper case
