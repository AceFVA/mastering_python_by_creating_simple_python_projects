# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print how many are odd numbers.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers with spaces in between
# create a list of numbers entered by the user
# set a variable with an initialized value of 0 as a container for the total number of odds
# create a for loop and iterate an item on the given list
# if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 1, then that number is odd
# odd + 1
# print the total number of odds
