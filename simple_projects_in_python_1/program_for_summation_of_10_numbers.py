# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print the sum of all the numbers.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers with spaces in between
numbers = input("Enter 10 numbers with spaces in between: ")
# example: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"

# create a list of numbers entered by the user
num_list = numbers.split()

# set a variable with an initialized value of 0 as a container for the summation of numbers
# create a for loop and iterate an item on the given list
# summation += num_list[i]
#print summation
