# Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the quotient of the two numbers without the decimal point

# set a variable to an initial value of 0
# while num is less than or equal to 100, enter loop
# if num % 2 is not equal to 0, then the number is odd
# print num
# num = num + 1
# when the number is even, num = num +1
