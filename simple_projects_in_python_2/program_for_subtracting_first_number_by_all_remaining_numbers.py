# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print the sum of all the numbers.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers with spaces in between
numbers = input("Enter 10 numbers with spaces in between: ")
# example: "100 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1"

# create a list of numbers entered by the user

# set a variable as a container for the first number

# create a for loop and iterate all items from the list

# difference = first number - second-last number

# print the difference
