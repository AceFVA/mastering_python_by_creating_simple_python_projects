# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print how many are even numbers.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers with spaces in between
numbers = input("Enter 10 numbers w/ spaces in between: ") 
# example: "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10"

# create a list of numbers entered by the user

# set a variable with an initialized value of 0 as a container for the total number of evens

# create a for loop and iterate an item on the given list

# if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 0, then that number is even

# even = even + 1

# print the total number of even
