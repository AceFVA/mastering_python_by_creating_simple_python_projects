# Create a program that ask user to input 10 numbers. Print how many are even numbers.

# ask the user to input 10 numbers with spaces in between
# create a list of numbers entered by the user
# set a variable with an initialized value of 0 as a container for the total number of evens
# create a for loop and iterate an item on the given list
# if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is equal to 0, then that number is even
# even = even + 1
# print the total number of even
