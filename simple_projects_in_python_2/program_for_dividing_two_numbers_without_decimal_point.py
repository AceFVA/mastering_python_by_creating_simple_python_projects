# Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the quotient of the two numbers without the decimal point
 
# ask the user to input 2 numbers
num_1 = int(input("Input your first number: "))
num_2 = int(input("Input your second number: "))

# check if the second number is not equal to zero
# num_1 / num_2
# print the quotient without decimal point
