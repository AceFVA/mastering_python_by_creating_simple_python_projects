# capitalize() makes the first letter of the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case.
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using capitalize() function.

# set a variable with a string element
# iterate all characters in the given string
# check if the iterated character is a letter
# replace the first alphabet character by its capitilized case
# end loop if the first letter was capitalized
# print string in capitalized case
