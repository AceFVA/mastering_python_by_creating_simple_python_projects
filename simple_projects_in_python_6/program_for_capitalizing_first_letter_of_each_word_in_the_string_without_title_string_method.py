# title() makes all first letter of each word in the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case.
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using title() function.

# set a variable with string element
# split each word
# create an empty list for title-cased words
# iterate all letters in each words
# if letter is an lphabet character
# replace letter by its capital casing
# end the loop if the first letter was capitalized
# print the string in title case
