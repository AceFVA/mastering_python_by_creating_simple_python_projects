# title() makes all first letter of each word in the string, capital letter. And all other letter in small case.
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using title() function.

# set a variable with string element
string = ".!?ace francis v. agustin"

# split each word
word_list = string.split()

# create an empty list for title-cased words
in_title_case = []

# iterate all letters in each words

# if letter is an lphabet character

# replace letter by its capital casing

# end the loop if the first letter was capitalized

# print the string in title case
print(in_title_case)
