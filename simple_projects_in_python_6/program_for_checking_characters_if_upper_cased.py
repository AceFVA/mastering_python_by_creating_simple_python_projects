# isupper() check if all characters of the string is on upper case.
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using isupper() function.

# create a variable with string type element
# create a variable the numbers of uppercased and  non-alphanumeric characters
# iterate all characters in the given string
# if a character is not in lowercase,
# uppercase variable + 1
# if a character is not alphanumeric,
# uppercase variable + 1
# if uppercase variable is equal to the length of the string,
# print "All characters are in UPPERCASE"
# if uppercase variable is not equal to the length of the string
# print "All characters are not in UPPERCASE"
