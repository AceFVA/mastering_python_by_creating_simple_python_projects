# lower() converts all characters of the string into lower case. Create a program that do the same functionality without using lower() function.

# set a variable with an element of string of characters
# create an empty list for lower cased characters
# create a for loop to iterate all items in the given string
# if char in string is in upper case,
# change the case of the char and add to the list
# if char is not in upper case,
# add char to the list
# print the string of characters in lower case
